title: "Affect Detection and Analysis"
excerpt: "Detect, analyze, and intervene affect in virtual learning environments using facial expression, self reports and interaction data"
collection: portfolio
---

Facial expression trackers output activations for facial action units (AUs) that comprise different affects. We compile patterns of AUs seen in related work as well as use factor analysis to search for affect categories implicit in our corpus.

__Data__ - Video, interaction log, affect annotations   
__Methods__ - Facial expression analysis, factor analysis

In a randomized controlled study, we investigate the impact of different types of affective messages delivered by pedagogical agents in an online math tutor on student behavior and affect.
