Math identity, or the degree to which one considers oneself a “math person,” has become an area of interest among social scientists hoping to better understand what drives students to enter Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. We leverage natural language processing (NLP), click-stream analyses, temporal features of performance, and survey data to predict students’ mathematics success and math identity (namely, self-concept, interest, and value of mathematics) in a blended learning environment. Following our limited success with purely cognitive approaches, we explore the influence of social factors on the relationship between students’ interaction with the learning system and their math identity.
