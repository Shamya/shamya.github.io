I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [UPenn](https://home.www.upenn.edu/) working in the [Penn Center for Learning Analytics](http://www.upenn.edu/learninganalytics/) with Professor [Ryan Baker](http://www.upenn.edu/learninganalytics/ryanbaker/index.html). Previously, I earned a B.E in Computer Science from SJCE India and a M.S. in Computer Science from [UMass Amherst](http://www.cs.umass.edu/) with an emphasis in Machine Learning, where I worked with Professor [Beverly P. Woolf](https://www.cics.umass.edu/faculty/directory/woolf_beverly) and Professor [Ivon Arroyo](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/arroyo-ivon) at the [Center for Knowledge Communication](https://www.cics.umass.edu/research/group/center-knowledge-communication). 


In summer 2017 I interned as a Data Scientist with Dr. [Antonio Nucci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-nucci-phd-aa6b70116/) at the Advanced Technologies and AI lab at Cisco, where I worked on [neural network-assisted computer network management](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/92/dc/e3/87f33ac348b9b2/US20190197397A1.pdf). Between 2011-2015 I worked as a Software Engineer at [Cisco Systems](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/index.html) on data-driven problem solving in Service Supply Chain. In 2016 I was a visiting researcher at the [USC Institute for Creative Technologies](http://ict.usc.edu/) working with Dr. [Benjamin Nye](https://sites.google.com/site/benjaminnye/) and Dr. [Mark Core](http://people.ict.usc.edu/~core/) on promoting student engagement in virtual learning environments. 


In 2018 at [Catalyst @ Penn GSE](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/catalyst) I designed and taught a pilot of [EXACT](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/innovation/exact), a 30-week teacher professional development program on Computational Thinking. In 2019 we won two [PAmart advancing grants](https://www.education.pa.gov/Policy-Funding/SchoolGrants/PAsmart/Pages/AdvancingGrants.aspx) of ~$500k each from the PA Department of Education to implement it in our school districts.
